The Hapless Bunnies

Once upon a time lived two bunnies in the forest.
One of the bunnies was grey.
The other was brown.
They were tiny little bunnies.
These bunnies were harassed by the wolves all the time.
They were really afraid of the wolves.
They had big claws and sharp teeth.
The bunnies decided to go to the gym.
They wanted to grow big muscles.
They wanted to be frightening for the wolves.
Even they took steroid.
One day their dream came true.
They grew bigger than the wolves.
The wolves started to be afraid of them.
Unfortunately the hunter took notice of them.
The day had come.
The bunnies wanted to kill the wolves.
They planned to eat them.
At this time the hunter shot the bunnies.
The wolves laught hard.
One of them laughed so hard he died.
The hunter brought the bunnies home and skinned them.
His family had food for a whole year.
But the flesh was full with steroids.
The wife of the hunter grew a beard.
It ruined their marriage.
So they didn't lived happily ever after.
